Welcome to MakerForge.tech! This is a platform where I share projects, ideas, and guides in the world of robotics, electronics and DIY innovation.

The mission of Maker Forge is to inspire and empower makers, hobbyists, and enthusiasts to explore the world of open-source robotics, electronics & 3D printing. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, the projects and resources here are designed to help you unleash your creativity and bring your ideas to life.

The main project is the award winning [Modular Robotics Framework](/modular-biped/) which is a biped robot built on an versatile and accessible platform for building robots of all shapes and sizes. This framework is open-source and 3D printable, making it easy for anyone to get started with robotics.

I hope you enjoy the content and find it useful. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to get in touch.

## About Dan

Dan is a Software Engineering Manager with over 20 years of experience as a software engineer and architect. 

Having always been interested in robotics and electronics, Dan began experimenting with Arduino microcontrollers and later Raspberry Pis, which led to a passion for building and programming robots.

During COVID lockdown he began a 'small' project which evolved into a [Modular Biped Robotics Framework](/modular-biped/). After making the project open-source and 3D printable, Dan built a vibrant community around it, with over 25k followers. The project also won the [Thingiverse Innovate and Automate Challenge in 2024](https://www.thingiverse.com/challenges/pcbway), and was a finalist in the [RealVNC Raspberry Pi Prize](https://www.realvnc.com/en/blog/realvnc-raspberry-pi-prize-finalist-dan-nicholson-companion-robot/).

Through the MakerForge.tech website, Dan shares learnings, guides, and project details while collaborating with partners and fellow makers to continue evolving the modular biped, as well as other projects which can be found on the site.
